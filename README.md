The Kele Ruby Gem API client is used to access the Bloc boot camp's own API.  This Ruby Gem will allow the user to:

1.) Initialize and Authorize Kele w/ a Bloc username and password
2.) Retrieve the current user as a JSON blob
3.) Retrieve a list of the current mentor's availability
4.) Retrieve roadmaps and checkpoints
5.) Retrieve a list of user messages, respond to an existing message and create a new message thread
6.) Submit checkpoints

This project is a part of my apprenticeship through Bloc
